## BUT HOW?!

I'm so glad you asked.

### Pick it from the menu

- Selecting "Log contents of My Drive" will create a new sheet containing a catalog of the entire contents of the current user's "My Drive".  The new sheet will have a name of the following format:

`<Your Name> <current date> <current time>`

- Selecting "Log contents of Shared Drives Drive" will create a new sheet containing a catalog of the entire contents of all of the current user's shared drives.  The new sheet will have a name of the following format:

`<Your Name> <current date> <current time>`

That's it!  Have fun.
